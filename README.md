# Crime-Web-Database

The idea of the project is to test our understanding of SQL injection code in C# using a Azure database filled with most recent crime data surrounding the chicago land area. The objective is to use a series of Model/View controllers to set specific data in proper position and record the user input correctly. By having multiple  inputs asking for things like which county they would like to look at or what date they would want to see the most violent crimes happen at, or even valentines day areas to avoid. As you download the file you will also notice a netflix database along with it as it is optimized for both crime and netflix shows. You will also see that it has 2 zip files together due to the size of the file not being able to import to github. so you should donload the file click into the zip folder and see both crime and netflix folders avaliable.
